# nesru
NES ROM utils

This is a somewhat useful text-mode reimplementation of the classic
NESSc program.

NOTE: The source code is somewhat obtuse, as this was originally
written way back, as a Rust learning exercise. It's basically thrown
over the fence in the hope that it might be useful. Please note that
it is practically untested.
